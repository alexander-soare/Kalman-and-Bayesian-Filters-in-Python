    "**Gating** is a mechanism for rejecting outlier measurements. After all, the Kalman Filter is proven to be optimal in the least squares sense, so it makes sense to remove outliers the same way you would if you were doing RANSAC with linear least squares on a scatter plot. So for example, consider the radar example with x-y co-ordinates of a plane. If a new measurement comes in that's 500 km from the prediction and our time step is 3 seconds, it's clear that the measurement is a dud. But where do we set the line?\n",
    "\n",
    "One basic approach would be to do a cutoff at 3 standard deviations from the prediction. We can do that cutoff with each of x and y independently, meaning we have a rectangular gate, we can use [Mahalanobis distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance) to get the distance of the measurement in terms of standard deviations.

    "Rule of thumb. A good way to evaluate filter performance is by plotting residuals vs variance (or more specifically, some number of standard deviations). We want approximately 68% of the residuals to fall withing 1 standard deviation, 97% to fall within two standard deviations, and 99.7% to fall within 3 standard deviations.\n",
